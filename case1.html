        <h1 class="text">Katie was robbed and killed by her neighbor.
            He came to her house, took all her valuables and money, and decided to get rid of Katie so that she
            wouldn't rat him out. Killer forced her to write a suicide note! She writes:
            MY DEAR, FORGIVE ME! I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
            HERE IS THE CODE OF OUR LOCKER IN THE BANK 73 63 22 32 73 81
            PLEASE, CALL MY MOM, and then the killer shoots her. After that, her husband reached the house and called the police. Husband read the note and says:
            So weird, we have no locker... Police said that there are no signs of a break-in.
            Husband said that they have four suspicious neighbors. Peter, Drake, Jack and Robert.
            Police went to question them.</h1>
